## Firebase Authentication for Spring boot

Firebase is a backendless platform to run applications without dedicated backend. But, sometimes you may need to communicate with API of an exisiting backend or you may want a dedicated backend to perform operations that cannot be done using firebase infrastructure .

This **Spring Boot Starter** is perfect for such situations when you want to extend firebase's authentication menchanism with **Spring Security** to seamlessly create and use protected rest API's.

### Configuration

Be sure to add the following environment variable globally or project specific run configuration environment variable

 * GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=path_to_firebase_server_config.json

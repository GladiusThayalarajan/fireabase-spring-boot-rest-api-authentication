Firebase is a backendless platform to run applications without dedicated backend. But, sometimes you may need to communicate with API of an exisiting backend or you may want a dedicated backend to perform operations that cannot be done using firebase infrastructure .

This **Spring Boot Starter** is perfect for such situations when you want to extend firebase's authentication menchanism with **Spring Security** to seamlessly create and use protected rest API's.

### Configuration

- Be sure to add the following environment variable globally or project specific run configuration environment variable `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=path_to_firebase_server_config.json`

- The starter can be configured to use firebase session as client side / strictly server side or both together.
- Htty Only / Secure enabled Session cookies may not work as expected in development hosts (localhost, 120.0.0.1). Adding self signed ssl certificate with reverse proxied host will work perfectly fine.
- Following application properties can edited to customize for your needs. Sample @ [application.yaml](src/main/resources/)

Firebase is a backendless platform to run applications without dedicated backend. But, sometimes you may need to communicate with API of an exisiting backend or you may want a dedicated backend to perform operations that cannot be done using firebase infrastructure .

This **Spring Boot Starter** is perfect for such situations when you want to extend firebase's authentication menchanism with **Spring Security** to seamlessly create and use protected rest API's.

### Configuration

- Be sure to add the following environment variable globally or project specific run configuration environment variable `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=path_to_firebase_server_config.json`

- The starter can be configured to use firebase session as client side / strictly server side or both together.
- Htty Only / Secure enabled Session cookies may not work as expected in development hosts (localhost, 120.0.0.1). Adding self signed ssl certificate with reverse proxied host will work perfectly fine. Read this article => [Create Local Domains with SSL for all Development Web Applications](https://thepro.io/post/create-local-domains-with-ssl-for-all-development-web-applications-Ya)
- Following application properties can edited to customize for your needs. Sample @ [application.yaml](src/main/resources/)

### Role Management

- Roles can be added through `SecurityRoleService` during registeration of user or manually managed by Super admins
- Super Admins are defined through application property `security.super-admins`
- With roles interated with spring security, spring authorization annotations like @Secured, @RolesAllowed, @PreAuthorize, @PostAuthorized etc will work out of the box.
- I personally like to define per role annotations like @IsSuper, @IsSeller etc for the sake of simplicity.

```
    @GetMapping("data")
	@isSeller
	public String getProtectedData() {
		return "You have accessed seller only data from spring boot";
	}
```

- UI useAuth hook also has utility properties like roles, hasRole, isSuper, isSeller properties exposed accross the application to allow or restrict access to specific UI components
